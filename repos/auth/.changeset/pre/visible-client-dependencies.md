Acquire database, transport, credential-store, and private-output dependencies through Effect services. BEHAVIOR CHANGE: provide each Drizzle driver's `Database` through `databaseLayer` and call its factories with mappings only; provide `Current*Sql` or `NativeDatabase` when acquiring shared Adapter services; select client stores by service key, provide `OperationHttpClient.Client` to `AuthAtom.makeLifetime(options)`, and supply OpenID fetch overrides through `FetchHttpClient.Fetch`.
